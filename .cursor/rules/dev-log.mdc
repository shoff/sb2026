# rule content:

After each interaction or modification to the solution, the agent must append or update a markdown file named {mmddyy}.md, where the format represents the current UTC date in MMDDYY (e.g., 042225.md for April 22, 2025). These files are store in the root of the solution in a folder named dev_log.

This markdown file must include the following top-level sections:

## Summary

A concise but complete explanation of what was accomplished in the latest update.

## Current Work

A clear outline of what functionality, design, data, or concepts are currently being worked on.

## Remaining Tasks

A prioritized list of unfinished or pending features, bugs, or refactors.

## Recommendations

AI-suitable suggestions for architectural improvements, optimizations, features, integrations, or validations based on current progress.
The markdown must be cleanly structured, valid UTF-8 text, and use standard Markdown 1.0 syntax to ensure compatibility with vector-based semantic ingestion.

The file must be written or updated immediately after each completed reply or operation.

If no work has occurred yet, the agent will generate an initial scaffold markdown file with empty sections except ## Summary, which should state: Session initialized.

Do not create placeholder or empty bullet points. If a section has no content yet, omit it entirely.

The agent must never duplicate entries. If the task was already listed and is now completed, remove it from Remaining Tasks and describe it under Summary.

All recommendations should be grounded in the current codebase and progress—no vague or speculative filler allowed.


If the correct .md file does not exist, create it!
