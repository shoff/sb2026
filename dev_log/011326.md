## Summary

Created `project_information.md` as the canonical architectural index for the Shadowbane Asset Viewer project. This document serves as the primary reference for understanding project structure, components, patterns, naming conventions, and system architecture. The file includes comprehensive sections covering asset management, code organization, rendering system, animation pipeline, configuration requirements, and known limitations.

Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shadowbane_viewer'` by correcting import statements in `main.py`. Changed all imports from `shadowbane_viewer.*` to direct module imports (e.g., `from ui.main_window import MainWindow` instead of `from shadowbane_viewer.ui.main_window import MainWindow`). The project structure uses direct subdirectory modules rather than a `shadowbane_viewer` package wrapper.

Fixed `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package` by converting all relative imports to absolute imports across the codebase. Updated files: `ui/opengl_viewport.py`, `rendering/camera.py`, `ui/export_dialog.py`, `animation/skeletal_animator.py`, `animation/animation_controller.py`, and `ui/main_window.py`. All imports now use absolute paths (e.g., `from rendering.camera import Camera` instead of `from ..rendering.camera import Camera`).

## Current Work

Project documentation and architectural reference maintenance. Import path corrections completed.

## Remaining Tasks

None - project_information.md creation and import fixes completed.

## Recommendations

- Review and update project_information.md as new components or patterns are introduced
- Consider adding API contracts section if the application evolves to include plugin or extension systems
- Add performance benchmarks section if optimization work is undertaken in Phase 5
