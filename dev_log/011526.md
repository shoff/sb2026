## Summary
Resumed Phase B at checkpoint B6 using the authoritative automation artifacts `ghidra_scripts/sb.exe_B6_unblock_0040B979_report.md/.json`.
Confirmed `0x0040B979` is not inside a larger missing function; it is `thunk_FUN_005b6790` implemented as `JMP 0x005b6790` and is referenced indirectly via a function-pointer table rooted at `0x015498A0` (entry count 39; entry index 11 points to `0x0040B979`).
Confirmed table entry targets via `get_xrefs_from` at `0x015498C0..0x015498D4`, including `0x015498CC → 0x0040B979` (thunk).
Identified a direct virtual-call site to the table slot: `FUN_005b6760` performs `(**(code **)(**(int **)(this+0x14) + 0x2C))(param_1,param_2,param_3)` (vcall offset +0x2C), which resolves to vtable entry 11 (`0x0040B979`) in the `0x015498A0` table.
Confirmed code locations that materialize the table pointer into objects via `MOV [obj], 0x015498A0` in multiple functions (`FUN_005b5b00`, `FUN_005b5d20`, `FUN_005b5ef0`, `FUN_005b6fe0`) and validated several reported indirect callsites (`CALL dword ptr [vtable + 0x8]`) that dispatch through objects whose vtable is set to `0x015498A0`.
Decompiled `FUN_005b6790` and verified its immediate-mode draw path (`thunk_FUN_005aadc0`) and alternate virtual dispatch via `(*this_00 + 0x30)`.
Captured B1 evidence in `FUN_005cc2f5`: `ArcRenderObject+0xEC` is used as a vtable object and invoked at slots `+0x14` and `+0x0C` (callsites `0x005cc549` and `0x005cc554`).
Started B2: vtable candidate `0x0154EBD8` entries resolved by `get_xrefs_from` for offsets `+0x0C` and `+0x14` to `0x0041A195` and `0x00426F49`, but neither address has a defined function in the current database.

## Current Work
- Executing B2: resolve vtable slot targets at `+0x0C` and `+0x14` for the RenderQueueLike object.

## Remaining Tasks
- Locate the real function boundaries for `0x0041A195` and `0x00426F49` (targets of vtable slots `+0x0C` and `+0x14`) or prove they are thunks.
- Continue B2.5 after B2 targets are resolved.

## Recommendations
- Treat `0x015498A0` as a vtable-like dispatch table; name it only after confirming which slot indices are invoked and with what `this` objects.
